# Twitter Bot

Twitter Bot

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

-   To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

-   To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

        $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy twitter_bot

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    $ pytest

### Celery

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

```bash
cd twitter_bot
celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info
```

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important _where_ the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with _manage.py_, you should be right.

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. If you choose to use [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) when generating the project a local SMTP server with a web interface will be available.

1.  [Download the latest MailHog release](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/releases) for your OS.

2.  Rename the build to `MailHog`.

3.  Copy the file to the project root.

4.  Make it executable:

        $ chmod +x MailHog

5.  Spin up another terminal window and start it there:

        ./MailHog

6.  Check out <http://127.0.0.1:8025/> to see how it goes.

Now you have your own mail server running locally, ready to receive whatever you send it.

### Sentry

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at <https://sentry.io/signup/> or download and host it yourself.
The system is set up with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.

## Deployment

The following details how to deploy this application.

### Heroku

Use the below commands to deploy on heroku

```
heroku create --buildpack heroku/python

heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
# On Windows use double quotes for the time zone, e.g.
# heroku pg:backups schedule --at "02:00 America/Los_Angeles" DATABASE_URL
heroku pg:backups schedule --at '02:00 America/Los_Angeles' DATABASE_URL
heroku pg:promote DATABASE_URL

heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev

# Assuming you chose Mailgun as mail service (see below for others)
heroku addons:create mailgun:starter

heroku config:set PYTHONHASHSEED=random

heroku config:set WEB_CONCURRENCY=4

heroku config:set DJANGO_DEBUG=False
heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production
heroku config:set DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 64)"

# Generating a 32 character-long random string without any of the visually similar characters "IOl01":
heroku config:set DJANGO_ADMIN_URL="$(openssl rand -base64 4096 | tr -dc 'A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z2-9' | head -c 32)/"

# Set this to your Heroku app url, e.g. 'bionic-beaver-28392.herokuapp.com'
heroku config:set DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=

# Assign with AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
heroku config:set DJANGO_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=

# Assign with AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
heroku config:set DJANGO_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

# Assign with AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
heroku config:set DJANGO_AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=

git push heroku master

heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser

heroku run python manage.py check --deploy

heroku open
```

#### to setup celery in heroku

Celery requires a few extra environment variables to be ready operational. Also, the worker is created, itâ€™s in the Procfile, but is turned off by default:

_Set the broker URL to Redis_

```
heroku config:set CELERY_BROKER_URL=`heroku config:get REDIS_URL`
```

_Scale dyno to 1 instance_

```
heroku ps:scale worker=1
```
